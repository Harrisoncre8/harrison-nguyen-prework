// Grab a user input using a prompt() and store it in a variable.
let userInput = prompt('Insert user input here');

// Add a conditional statement where if the variable's length is greater than 4, we alert the user that their name is greater than four characters.
// Otherwise, alert that their name is less than four characters.
