# Harrison Nguyen Prework

This is Harrison Nguyen's repository that holds all prework assessments for Genesis10.

Duration: 2 weeks

All of the projects within this reposity was built within 2 weeks time - culminating with a guessing word game built in vanilla JavaScript and styled primarily with CSS. The game is structured as an object with global variables and a few event listeners. You can find my code within the assests folder inside of the javascript folder. I started by flowcharting all the features that were required within the game and utilized online resources like w3schools, developer.mozilla, and stack overflow to find built-in functions and methods. Feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any questions about my code.
